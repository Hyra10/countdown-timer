# Pure JS Countdown Clock

This is an old project I did back in 2015, to learn pure old javascript while creating something good at the same time with an observer and prototypal inheritance

## Installation

There is no need to install anything since it has no dependencies or any bundler, it is a pure HTML/JS/CSS project

## Usage

You just need to open countdown.html in your preferred browser
